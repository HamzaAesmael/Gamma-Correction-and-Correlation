The main goals of this lab are:

To Understand and Implement Gamma Correction: This is an image enhancement technique used to adjust the brightness and contrast of an image in a non-linear way. It's particularly useful for making details in dark areas more visible or toning down overly bright areas.

To Understand and Implement Template Matching using Correlation: This is a method used to find a small image (a "template") within a larger image. It works by calculating how "similar" the template is to different patches of the larger image, identifying the location of the best match.

Overall, this lab is about learning fundamental image processing techniques: preparing an image for analysis (gamma correction) and finding objects of interest within it (template matching via correlation).
